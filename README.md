This project is a simple contacts web app that allows the user to create, see, edit and delete their contacts.

Its skeleton is based in the fullstack boilerplate by BurakDmb that you can check out [here](https://github.com/BurakDmb/MERN-EasyBoilerplate).

It uses MERN stack:
- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- NodeJS

### For running in development environment:
 - Install mongoDB and create a simple database or create a cloud based one (I recommend [this](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud))
 -  ```npm run start´´´
   
### For deploying into production environment(Heroku) using GitHub:
